        <p>
            Welcome to the <strong>Cross Reality Collaboration Sandbox (CRCS) research group</strong>
            at the Computing and Software Systems Division, University of Washington Bothell.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our team investigates how to support people working in collaboration addressing
            issues across realities where the solutions may span the continuum between physical
            and virtual spaces. One of the goals of our group is to facilitate the collaborations
            between participants that are located in a physical space of interests with
            participants that are located remotely.
